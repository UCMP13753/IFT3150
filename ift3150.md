## 3. Description détaillée
- Outline of the proposed research project
    Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors are crucial in the investment decision of a company, considering its sustainability and societal impact. Asset managers and financial institutions are increasingly relying on ESG rating agencies to assess, measure, and compare the ESG performance of companies. However, there is not yet a methodological standard for measuring ESG performance. The information necessary to understand the ESG impact of a company is contained in an unstructured format. Therefore, artificial intelligence can be helpful to interpret this unstructured data and assess the ESG performance of companies.   
  
    One of the challenges in this project is the availability, reliability, and volume of ESG data. This data comes from multiple sources such as several types of corporate documents, websites, and data portals which are intrinsically unstructured and non-standardized. To overcome the processing challenge of this data, we propose using natural language processing (NLP) to extract topics and transfer the unstructured data to structured data that can be used for analyzing better the text in terms of ESG concepts. 
  
- Outline of the student's role   
    The student will focus on developing Python scripts to extract ESG insights from text. This includes extracting ESG topics and sentiment from text data. The goal will be to improve the accessibility of the data by structuring the collected text. He will help to develop a search engine tool to enable users to retrieve the extracted ESG text data. He will also develop and deploy python scripts to visualize topics and the result of the ESG analysis. 
  
- Industrial component  
    Lucid Axon provides transparent ESG insight and data using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence models. They work with investors, policymakers, and ESG advisors, and empower their clients with a deeper understanding of ESG data, toward redirecting capital to the right places and building a more solid, sustainable future. They provide unique solutions by developing new algorithms and methodologies to give access to accurate ESG data and tools. Their clients get the benefits of customizable tools to create their own analysis and adapt their solutions with a better understanding of their ESG environment and a clear path towards their sustainable goals. Lucid Axon is initiating the development of client solutions and tools aimed at automatizing the acquisition, processing, and analysis of publicly available, unstructured data relating to ESG aspects. They are currently working on improving their AI models to analyze ESG text data with higher accuracy.
    With the increasing amount of textual data to analyze, machine learning algorithms could potentially provide a powerful way to increase processing efficiency and reduce client costs. This would be achieved by automatizing the identification, clustering, and interpretation of relevant reports, in order to augment human analysts’ capabilities. Lucid Axon wishes to offer its clients such AI-powered solutions to complement fundamental ESG analysis, hereby maximizing value to their existing and future clients, all the while reducing their costs.
